# Task
Create an API that has POST and GET methods. Use a relational database for persistence.

Suggested minimal architecture:

- Docker compose containing a flask api and postgres.

Tips:

- Investigate mounting the storage for your database solution so that you donâ€™t lose your data if you lose the docker container.

Suggested Options / Extensions:
- Nginx reverse proxy/ load balancer
- Host in AWS
- Create a frontend web application that uses your api
- Learn how to use mocking to test the api code that interacts with the db
